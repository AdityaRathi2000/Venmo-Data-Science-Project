# Venmo-Data-Science-Project

The Venmo DS Project was about using what was learned during the school year to run classification models and neural networks on a huge data set (+7,000,000 courtesey Github user sa7mon) of Venmo transactions to draw meaningul conclusions and recommendations for Venmo. 

# Models used

There were several methods of EDA used, however the main models that were developed and used were Random Forest, SVM, linear and logistic regression and three types of neural networks, including feed-forward NN. 

# Conclusions

The model allows users to be defined with a score that reprsents how loyal they are (poor or premium users of Venmo). We recommended 'poorer' users be incentivized to use the app more by offering them discounts on the Venmo credit card or move up on the waitlist for the venmo credit card, as well as other perks. The more 'premium' users can also be helped, by offering them the ability to transact more than the daily limit (30) and additional perks!
